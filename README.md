## Introduction

This Authentication System is a Node.js application that provides user authentication and registration functionality. It includes user registration, login, password reset, and JWT-based authentication. The system is built using modern JavaScript and uses popular libraries and frameworks such as Express, MongoDB, and more.

## Features

- User Registration: Allowing users to create new accounts.
- User Login: Authenticating users and generating JWT tokens.
- Password Reset: Resetting user passwords via email.
- Rate Limiting: Protecting against brute-force attacks.
- Secure: Implementing security best practices, including helmet and bcrypt.
- Logging: Logging requests using Morgan.
- Error Handling: Handling errors and exceptions gracefully.
- Configuration: Using dotenv for environment variable management.
- Testing: Includes sample test cases.
- Ready for Deployment: Configured for easy deployment to platforms like Heroku or AWS.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (16 or higher)
- MongoDB (or a MongoDB cloud service)
- npm or yarn (package managers)
- Git (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authentication-system.git
cd authentication-system
```

2. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory based on the `.env.example` file provided.

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration settings, including database connection details, JWT secret, and other environment-specific variables.

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Express server, and your authentication system will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can customize the port and other settings in the `.env` file.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/login**: Log in and obtain a JWT token.
- **POST /api/forgotpassword**: Send an email to reset the password.
- **POST /api/resetpassword/:token**: Reset the user's password with a valid token.
- **POST /api/changepassword**: Change the user's password.
- **GET /api/profile**: Get the user's profile (protected route). (Coming Soon)

## Testing (Coming Soon)

To run the sample test cases, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

You can add more test cases in the `test` directory as needed.

## Deployment

This Authentication System is ready for deployment to various cloud platforms. You can use services like Heroku, AWS, or others to host your application. Be sure to configure the environment variables accordingly for production deployment.
